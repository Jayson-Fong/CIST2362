# 2. Test Scores #1 [Code](2:Test_Scores_1.cpp)
The primary objective is to practice using pointers, so they are almost everywhere possible. The program asks for several test scores, then orders them, calculates an average for them, and displays them.

## Required Criteria
1. Dynamically allocates an array for holding a user-defined number of test scores.
2. Pass the scores array of test scores to a function for sorting in ascending order.
3. Call a function to calculate the average score.
4. Display the sorted list of scores and averages with appropriate headings.
5. Use pointer notation instead of arrays whenever possible.
6. Do not accept negatives for test scores.
7. Offer users the option to continue or exit.
