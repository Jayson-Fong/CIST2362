# C++ Programming II Programming Projects
Programming projects for C++ Programming II, primarily based upon [Tony Gaddis's _Starting Out with C++ from Control Structures to Objects_, 9th Edition](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Gaddis-Starting-Out-with-C-from-Control-Structures-to-Objects-Plus-My-Lab-Programming-with-Pearson-e-Text-Access-Card-Package-9th-Edition/PGM335156.html).

Feel free to take inspiration from my works; however, usage constitutes attribution.
